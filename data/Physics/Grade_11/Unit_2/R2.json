      "options": {
        "A": "It assumes cos 90° equals 1 instead of 0.",
        "B": "It confuses the dot product with the vector cross product.",

      "explanation": "The dot product A·B = AB cos θ. For θ = 90°, cos 90° = 0, so the dot product is zero, not positive. Option B is incorrect because the cross product of perpendicular vectors is non-zero, but that's a different operation.",
